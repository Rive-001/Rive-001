# Rishi Verma

I'm interested in machine learning and data science. I've worked on machine learning projects in the domains of computer vision and computational genomics. I'm in the final semester of my Masters in Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University and **I'm looking to work full-time as a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist in an industrial setting.**

## Skills

### Domains

* Computational Genomics: SpliceAI
* Computer Vision : Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), ResNet-34
* NLP: attention-based sequence-to-sequence model

### Programming Languages

* Python, MySQL, Shell scripting

### Machine Learning Frameworks

* Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras

### Data Science Tools

* NumPy, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn

### Computing Software and Platforms

* Pyspark, AWS, Databricks

## Projects

### [Adversarial Defense Using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/Rive-001/counterGAN)

* Developed a novel GAN using the CIFAR-10 dataset to defend a target classifier against adversarial attacks.
* Benchmarked against a custom dataset to record an improvement in model accuracy by up to 14% from a
defenceless target.


### [Database of eCLIP Assays for sequence comparison](https://github.com/Rive-001/DEA)

* Developed a pipeline using Shell scripting to extract sequences for protein binding from eCLIP assays.
* Developed an API to enable end-users to apply our pipeline to their own data.

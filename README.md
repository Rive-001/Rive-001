# Rishi Verma

I'm interested in machine learning and data science. I've worked on machine learning projects in the domains of computer vision and computational genomics. I'm in the final semester of my Masters in Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University and **I'm looking to work full-time as a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist in an industrial setting.**

## Skills

### Domains

* Computer Vision : Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), ResNet-34
* Computational Genomics: SpliceAI
* NLP: attention-based sequence-to-sequence model

### Programming Languages

* Python, MySQL, Bash

### Machine Learning Frameworks

* Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras

### Data Science Tools

* NumPy, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn

### Computing Software and Platforms

* Pyspark, AWS, Databricks

## Projects

### [Adversarial Defense Using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/Rive-001/counterGAN)

* Developed counterGAN, a generative adversarial network that denoised input adversarial images from CIFAR-10 dataset, to defend the target classifier against adversarial attacks.
* Performed experiments with different network architectures, loss functions and denoising techniques to improve the performance of our model, increasing accuracy by up to 14%.


### [Database of eCLIP Assays for sequence comparison](https://github.com/Rive-001/DEA)

* Developed a pipeline using Shell scripting to extract sequences for protein binding from eCLIP assays.
* Developed an API to enable end-users to apply our pipeline to their own data.
